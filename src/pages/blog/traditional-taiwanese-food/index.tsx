          Taiwanese cuisine is a fusion of flavors, textures, and aromas that
          reflect the island&apos;s rich cultural heritage. The Hokkien or Hoklo
          people who came from Fujian to Taiwan and all over the world brought
          with them a number of delicious recipes. Some of them having their
          origins from Fujian in China, and others being a unique Taiwanese
          creation, these dishes are now a big part of Taiwanese culture.
